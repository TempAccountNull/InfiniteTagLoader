# Instructions - [Video Tutorial](https://youtu.be/poUkumLYXOY)
  1. Launch the program.
  2. Open a level module.
  3. Find a tag you want to replace.
  4. Change the tag type combo box to the type of tag you want to load in. (weapon, vehicle, etc.)
  5. Close the module and start the match.
  
 # Notes
  - Make sure you backup your module files. It is possible to break the module by replacing the wrong tags.
  - If someone wants to make an icon for this, I will love you forever.
  - Some tags will work, some won't. All depends on whether the tag is in the module list for the level you are editing.
  - I have some plans for the future to try and improve this, starting with learning how to get tags from other modules to load.
